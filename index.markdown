## Exploration of the relationship between solar and wind energy generation and air quality in the United States
# **Skills:** _R, RStudio, Git_
![Installed solar and wind capacity](/files/states_gif.gif)
Through this group project, my team and I utilized R and publicly available datasets to explore the evolution of solar and
 wind energy generation in the period 2001 - 2021, and its impact on air quality with a focus on the states of Texas, California
 and Iowa in the United States. [See the full report.](/files/env872_project.html)

## Evaluation of the factors affecting residential solar adoption across 10 states in the United States
# **Skills:** _R, RStudio, Git_
![Plot of installations per capita vs electricity price](/files/installationspercapita_vs_electricityprice.png)
In this project, my colleague and I utilized R and publicly available datasets to explore whether residential solar adoption rates in the United States are higher in states with higher CO2 emissions per capita, average energy prices, and residential electricity demand per capita.

## GIS tool for vulnerability assessment of electric infrastructure to extreme weather events
# **Skills:** _Python, ArcGIS, Git_
![EV charger accessibility dashboard](/files/ev_charger_accessibility_dashboard.PNG)
In this project, my colleague and I developed a tool that would enable a user to assess the vulnerability of electrical infrastructure to extreme weather events using spatial analysis. Specifically, we sought to enable users to identify generation, transmission and electric vehicle (EV) charging assets that may be affected by extreme weather events such as sea level rise, flooding, or wildfires in the State of California. Additionally, we sought to evaluate how road accessibility to critical infrastructure such as transmission lines and EV charging stations might be impacted by these events leveraging a simplified analysis adapted from the 2022 paper by Jones et. al titled ‘Geospatial Assessment Methodology to Estimate Power Line Restoration Access Vulnerabilities After a Hurricane in Puerto Rico’.

## Energy Transition During Energy Crisis: Cape Town's Experience
# **Skills:** _Python, LEAP, Excel_
![Model Overview](/files/LEAP_model_overview.png)
In this project, I collaborated on an interdisciplinary research team to incorporate new distributed generation potential into a Cape Town energy system model using the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) to understand its implications for meeting energy demand from the grid, and for considering policy strategies for small scale embedded generation.

## ISO Decarbonization Strategy Model
# **Skills:** _Python, Energy Modeling, Excel_
![Process Flowchart](/files/NicISO_flowchart.png)
In this project, I co-developed a least-cost decarbonization strategy to achieve 95% emissions-free electricity generation despite demand and supply uncertainty for a representative power system ISO, utilizing Python-based production cost modeling, Monte Carlo analysis, and Excel-based financial modeling as highlighted in the process flow chart above.

## The Market Use Case for Solar + Storage Serving as a Mid-Merit Asset
# **Skills:** _Python, Energy Modeling, Excel, Statistical Clustering, Financial Modeling_
![Process Flowchart](/files/slowburners_performance.png)
In this project, my team evaluated the technical and economic feasibility of replacing mid-merit natural gas plants with solar-plus-storage in ERCOT for client Fluence Energy, using qualitative research, statistical clustering in Python, and financial modeling in Excel..
